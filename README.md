# Predicting Student Exam Performance

## Project Overview:
1. Collect or use a dataset with features like study_hours, sleep_hours, 
attendance_rate, and exam_score.
2. Task 1: Use Linear Regression to predict the exam_score based on 
study_hours.
3. Task 2: Use Decision Tree Classification to classify students as "Pass"
or "Fail" based on a threshold score (e.g., 40 marks).
4. Bonus: Visualize how study hours impact performance using scatter plots 
and decision boundaries.
